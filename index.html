            [Verse 1]
            You were the shadow to my light
            Did you feel us?
            Another star, you fade away
            Afraid our aim is out of sight
            Wanna see us alight
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            Where are you now?
            Where are you now?
            Where are you now?
            Was it all in my fantasy?
            Where are you now?
            Were you only imaginary?
            
            [Chorus]
            Where are you now?
            Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
            Where are you now? Another dream
            The monster's running wild inside of me
            I'm faded, I'm faded
            So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
            So lost, I'm faded
            
            [Verse 2]
            These shallow waters never met what I needed
            I'm letting go, a deeper dive
            Eternal silence of the sea
            I'm breathing, alive

            Where are you now?
            Where are you now?
            Under the bright but faded lights
            You set my heart on fire
            Where are you now?
            Where are you now?
            
            [Chorus]
            Where are you now?
            Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
            Where are you now? Another dream
            The monster's running wild inside of me
            I'm faded, I'm faded
            So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
            So lost, I'm faded</pre>
